- I had a hard time dwitching over to vanilla Javascript, and an issue with using Sass because of how new I am to it. The important thing is to keep going and be resilient and to be hungry for a solution, and know that there is one that is aquirable.

As I am still very new to SASS, I am still learning and this is proving to teach me a lot about using it. Here are my notes on the matter:
- Using BEM style helps.
- Use one media query at the bottom of the origional curly braces.
- Dont nest more than three levels. Utilize BEM by adding a class name and selecting the element that way.
- Maps are a lot to type out each time, so instead of using maps for variables that are accessed frequently (such as colors), use a regular variable, but name it in a way that it is easy to remember and access them all together. Like "$color-primary" or "$color-red".

- I used ezgif.com to create the gif and https://deviceshots.com/ to get the mockups. This site exports the svg's with lots of white space at the top :( so I used negative margin-top to negate it (thanks stack overflow user!!)
